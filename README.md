1. Create a Resource Group
2. Create a Storage Account within the Resource Group created in Step 1
3. Create a text file on your local desktop If you’re using a Mac, go to preferences and set it to plain text.
4. Upload the text file you created to the Azure Storage Account.
5. Edit the file within the Storage Account (within the Azure Portal)
6. Download the file
7. Open the file and observe the changes
8. Delete the Resource Group created in step 4 (in order to ensure you don’t incur “cost”)
9. Verify that the Resource Group has been deleted
